# Resume / CV for portfolio

**To add or update your resume:**

1. Export your resume as a PDF (from Google Docs, Word, LaTeX, etc.).
2. Save it here as **`resume.pdf`** (exactly that name).
   - First time: add the file `resume.pdf` in this `public/` folder.
   - Updates: replace the existing `resume.pdf` with your new file.
3. Commit and deploy. No code changes needed.

The "Download CV" / "Resume" links on the site point to `/resume.pdf`, which serves this file.
